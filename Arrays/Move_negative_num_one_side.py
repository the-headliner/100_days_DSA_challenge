# move all the negative elements to one side of the array


# Brute Force Approach --> Using Extra Space
# Time Complexity: O(n) - Single traversal of the array.
# Space Complexity: O(n) - Requires an additional array to store the result.

# Steps:
# Traverse the array and collect all the negative elements in one list.
# Collect all the positive or zero elements in another list.
# Combine the two lists and overwrite the original array.

# Optimized Approach --> In-Place Partitioning (Two-Pointer Technique)
# Time Complexity: O(n) - Single traversal of the array.
# Space Complexity: O(1) - No extra space used.

# Steps:
# Use two pointers:
# left starts at the beginning of the array.
# right iterates through the array.
# Whenever a negative number is found at the right pointer, swap it with the number at the left pointer and move left forward.
# This partitions the array into negatives on the left and non-negatives on the right.
